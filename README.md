# Environment

Before installing the Generator, you will need the following:
- Node.js 6 or higher
- npm 3 or higher (which comes bundled with Node)
- Git

You can check current version by:
```
    $ node --version
    $ npm --version
    $ git --version
```

# Installing

Install Yeoman tool at you local machine if it is absent there:
```
    $ npm install -g yo
    $ npm install -g generator-helm-phr
```

Go to the directory, where you will create your build, for example:
```
    $ cd /var/www/html/myDirectoryName/
```

Use Yeoman-generator to create your build automatically:
```
    $ yo helm-phr:core
    $ yo helm-phr:plugin-top-three-things 
    $ yo helm-phr:plugin-vaccinations 
    $ yo helm-phr:plugin-feeds 
    $ yo helm-phr:plugin-helm-phr --force
    $ yo helm-phr:plugin-user-tour
    $ yo helm-phr:plugin-terms-and-conditions
    $ yo helm-phr:update --force
```

Attribute **--force** is used for overwriting config files by default.

When you build will be created, go to project directory and create the build:
```
    $ cd PulseTile-React-Core
    $ npm run build
```

Your build will be located in two places:
- as zip-archive in **projectDirectory/build/**
- as set of files in **projectDirectory/dist/**
